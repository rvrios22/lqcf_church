        James 5:14-15, "Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of
        the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the
        name of the Lord: 15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and
        the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall
        be forgiven him.‚Äù
