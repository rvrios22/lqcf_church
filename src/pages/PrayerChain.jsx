        Our Prayer Chain ministry is led by Pastor Mark Cook. We meet the first
        Friday of each month at 7 PM in the Sanctuary to pray for the needs of
        those that have been submitted to us throughout the month. To join us in
        our prayer meetings please reach out to Pastor Cook to become part of
        the ministry.
